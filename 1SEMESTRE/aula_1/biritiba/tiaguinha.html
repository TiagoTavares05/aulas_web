    <h1>Nothing Else Matters</h1>
    <p>
        So close no matter how far<br>
        Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
        Forever trusting who we are<br>
        And nothing else matters<br>
        Never opened myself this way<br>
        Life is ours, we live it our way<br>
        All these words I don't just say<br>
        And nothing else matters<br>
        Trust I seek and I find in you<br>
        Every day for us something new<br>
        Open mind for a different view<br>
        And nothing else matters<br>
        Never cared for what they do<br>
        Never cared for what they know<br>
        But I know<br>
